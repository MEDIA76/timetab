## Timetab

A simple Chrome extension to show the time, or times, whenever a new tab is opened. Please be aware that this is an ongoing side project and may contain bugs from time to time while I improve it. [Creating issues](https://github.com/capachow/timetab/issues) on GitHub for reporting such bugs is always appreciated. Otherwise, enjoy!

### [Download](https://github.com/capachow/timetab/releases/latest/download/timetab.crx)

> Please note, until this extension is published on the Web Store, you will need to, temporarily, put Chrome in developer mode in order to install Timetab. Drag and drop the downloaded `timetab.crx` file onto `chrome://extensions`.
