## Timetab

A simple Chrome extension to show the time, or times, whenever a new tab is opened. Please be aware that this is an ongoing side project and may contain bugs from time to time while I improve it. [Creating issues](https://github.com/capachow/timetab/issues) on GitHub for reporting such bugs is always appreciated. Otherwise, enjoy!

- Display multiple clocks
- Show or hide custom labels
- Choose 12 or 24 hour time
